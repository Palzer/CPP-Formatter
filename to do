Work on:
	
	

Ideas:

	- add language detection
	- add new languages
	- move formatting of different languages, and tools into their own files and make corresponding header files
	- cpp formatting
		- something to remove spacing between lines if it isnt needed or limit spacing to one line max
		- something to put spacers between functions and eliminate anything in between that isnt code
	
Done:
	
	- makefile (change with added/changed files)
	- confirmation to overwrite backed up file if it already exists
	- if you do not specify to format or revert it gives you the program usage and help
	- detects file language by extension
	- alerts to unsupported files
	- can revert formatted file to the backup if available
	- formatting for cpp files (bugs may exist, need more testing on files)
		- puts braces on their own line
		- indents based on braces
		- does not match up with invalid braces (invalid = ones in quotes, ticks, or comments)
		- adds newlines after valid semicolons (invalid = ones in parenthesis)
		- limits consecutive empty lines to one
